# ACDH virtual Open Data hackathon series 2019: International Open Data Day hack
The repo containing your task for the third hackathon in the ACDH hackathon series 2019: International Open Data Day hack. This task is open for submissions from Feb 14, 2019 (2 p.m. CET) to Mar 02, 2019 (midnight CET). 

## Your task

The third hack of the ACDH virtual hackathon series is happening around the international Open Data Day and offers you a choice of two datasets. Pick the one that inspires you most and develop a creative mode of processing a textual dataset. It is your decision what to do with the data: You could enrich it, visualize it, do statistical analysis or develop an innovative application to explore it. You might even be inspired to develop a solution that incorporates both datasets.

The fist dataset to be worked on in this task is a collection of [XML/TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/guidelines/) transcriptions of early German travel guides on non-European countries which were released by the Baedeker publishing house between 1875 and 1914 (5 volumes, first editions). The texts are tokenized, labelled with lemmas as well as part-of-speech-tags, and semantically annotated. The dataset was compiled in the context of the [travel!digital](https://traveldigital.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) project.

The data and the accompanying TEI schema is available for download here:
* https://id.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/traveldigital/Corpus 
* https://id.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/traveldigital/Auxiliary_Files/TEI_schema 

The focus should be on functionalities that go beyond what the [travel!digital web-app](https://traveldigital.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) already offers.

We are offering the second dataset In cooperation with Europeana, the digital platform for cultural heritage funded by the European Union. It is composed of high definition images and full-text of 8 newspapers in German contributed by the Hamburg State and University Library Carl von Ossietzky to the Europeana's project on newspapers: http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/featured-partner-hamburg-state-and-university-library-carl-von-ossietzky/. 

The information on how to download the dataset is on a specific section at:
https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/iiif#download

The documentation page for the IIIF APIs is available at:
https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/iiif

We invite you to imagine its reuse in your field of research and/or to develop new modes of exploration and visualisation of large volumes of resources, in particular with full-text content.

## What your submission should contain

Each submission has to include code, an instruction on how to run it (readme), a short presentation of what was done (in a format of your choice: poster, video, description,...), enriched data (if applicable) and statistics on the data (if applicable).

## Judgement criteria

Your submission will be judged by the following criteria:
* Creativity, innovation  (e.g. Is the approach/idea new and unique? Does it do something that hasnâ€™t been done before? Does it provide new insights into the data? Does the hack provide a new/faster/clearer solution to the old problem?)
* Accessibility, reusability, reproducibility (e.g. Is the code properly documented? Is the technical approach reproducible?)
* Elegance (e.g. Is the code easy to modify and reuse? Is it readable for others? Is modularity considered in the design? Is the code simple and concise?)

## Openness

Participants will work on their solutions in a dedicated (own) GitHub repository. Once you have finished your work, set your repo to public, tag it #ACDHhackathonODD and send the repo link to vanessa.hannesschlaeger[at]oeaw.ac.at and tanja.wissik[at]oeaw.ac.at. 

All code submitted by all participants (as well as all reviews by all judges) shall be made permanently publicly available on GitHub under an MIT license (or similarly permissive license, respectively a fitting open license for submissions of enriched data and presentation material). By submitting their code to this challange, participants agree to these terms.
